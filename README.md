# Devies Presentations

The place for collecting materials used for presentations/demos/lectures etc held at Devies.

## Structure

- Each presentation have their own folder with the following naiming convention: `<yyyy-mm-dd>-<name-of-presentation>`

## What should I upload?

Depending on the type of presentation, the material used for the presentations varies.

Some examples:

- Slides exported as pdf. Include links to recordings and external resources, like source code.
- Notes from the audience or the presenter. Preferably in markdown.
- No slides avaiable? Create a `index.md` with a short description of the presentation and links to recording and external resources.
